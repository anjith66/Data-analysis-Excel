is_canceled: A binary value indicating if the booking was canceled.
lead_time: Number of days between booking and arrival.

2This file represents the final dashboard or summary sheet. It contains aggregated and summarized data derived from the raw hotel_booking.csv file. Instead of individual booking details, it shows key performance indicators (KPIs) and summaries, such as:
TOTAL GUEST: The total number of guests.
BOOKING CANCELLED: The total number of canceled bookings.
TOTAL BOOKING: The total number of bookings.
Row Labels: This likely represents a categorical field used for grouping, such as customer_type or hotel, to show the metrics for each group.

Operations Performed
The creation of Sheet1.csv from hotel_booking.csv involved several common data analysis operations:
Data Cleaning/Preparation: The raw data in hotel_booking.csv was likely cleaned to handle any missing or inconsistent values before aggregation.
Aggregation and Summarization: The raw data was grouped and summarized. For example:
TOTAL BOOKING was calculated by counting all rows in the raw data.
BOOKING CANCELLED was calculated by filtering for rows where is_canceled is 1 and then counting them.
TOTAL GUEST was calculated by summing the adults, children, and babies columns.
Pivoting or Grouping: Data was likely grouped by a specific category (e.g., customer_type) to create the "Row Labels" and show the summary metrics for each category. This process transforms the granular data into a more readable, summary table.
